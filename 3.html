<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
Although there are strong outward similarities between 
JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, 
and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct 
and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was influenced 
by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[10]
